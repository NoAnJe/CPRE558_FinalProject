# CPR E 558 Final Project
Energy simulator for CPR E 558 at Iowa State University.

In this course, one of the goals was to create some form of final project. For my final project, I chose to create a GUI simulator that compares a standard EDF scheduler, an inter-task DVS EDF scheduler, and an intra-task DVS EDF scheduler. Individual tasks can be added and removed at will. When running this simulator, more information can be found by pressing the blue "Help" button.
